* add names to threads (configurable?)
* s/printf/printk/
* error/info/debug reporting functions
* have some decent logging system
* cleanup early MMU mapping (remove the identity mapping)
* add a real fault handler
* free __init memory
* add support for no-mmu ?
* add support for DT?
* port to raspberry-pi (ARMV6 - ARM11)
* watchdog drivers
* add led driver
~ add clock subsystem
* add real timer subsystem
* cleanup this kapi thing
* cleanup scheduler
* some header need to move to uapi/?
* add a better kmalloc implementation

* IRQ
  ✓ generic irq operations (iomap irq base address at registration time)
  ~ chained interrupts
	✓ infrastructure
	* if all desc of child chip are masked, so should be the parent
  * irq_mask()/irq_unmask() should be nestable/recursive

* network
  * look for ethernet driver?
  * have a very simple stack 
  * have support for something very simple, like TFTP or ping
  ✓ make a decent skb_alloc()
  * ARP/neighbour tables
  * how to associate L3 addresses to interfaces
  * sending queue

* Block layer
  * infrastructure
  ✓ add basic support for SD card
  	* add support for DMA & scatter/gather
	* add support for HS
	* add support old version of SD specs (pre SDHC)
	? add support for MMC
  * add support for eMMC
  * would be nice to have support for SATA ...

* FS
  * vfs
  * FAT
  * a very simple filesystem
  * those are very little usefull without user space support ...

* SMP
  ✓ add memory barriers
  ✓ add (spin)locks
  ✓ add semaphores
  ✓ scheduler SMP-awareness
    ✓ wakeup: need to choose a good CPU (same as last or idle)
    ✓ wakeup: may need to wakeup others CPUs (IPI)
  * add per-cpu infrastructure ?

* RTC:
  * add basic support

* MM
  * add support for highmem

* ARM:
  * add support for ARMv4/ARMv5 ?
  * add support for LPAE ?
  * SMP:
    * add support for IPIs
    * really need per-cpu infrastructure

* ARM-v7M:
  ~ add basic supoort for interrupts & exceptions

* ARM64:
  ✓ drop from EL3 to EL1, as it should
  ✓ basic exception handling
  ✓ run on SDRAM
  ✓ enable MMU & dcache
  ✓ enable icache
  ✓ interrupts
  ✓ GIC
  ✓ timer
    ! per-cpu timers
  ~ SMP support
  * ioremap

* MIPS:
  ✓ add support for interrupts & other exceptions

* Serial:
  * generic serial-out
  ✓ add serial input
    * add support for a small monitor (dump info, read system registers, launch tests, ...)

* STM32:
  ✓ add support for timers
  * add support for RTC
